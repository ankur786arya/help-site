Tonight, we rolled out a new version of ScrumDo to the live production servers.  This was a fairly minor update that included a handful of improvements.

* Optimized some of the media delivery to make the site a little faster.
* Added this blog
* A new member management interface for projects.
* Site breadcrumbs to help navigate
* Moved several database tables to UTF8
* Improved the RSS feeds to make them more useful
* Fixed a handful of minor bugs.

Read on below the break for more details on a couple of these.
