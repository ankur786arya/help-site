Today, we rolled out a new daily digest email feature.  This lets you get a daily email with a burnup chart of the project and current iterations, as well as a listing of every story that changed in the past 24 hours, who changed it, and what was done to the story.

The digests are only available to organizations on a paid plan.  You can change your digest subscription settings in your [account settings](https://www.scrumdo.com/email/email_config).
