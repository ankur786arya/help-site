There's a new mode for integrating your Basecamp projects with Scrumdo.  It allows you to map your ScrumDo iterations to Basecamp todo lists.  This should help you to map the Agile process into your Basecamp account much more closely.

We also added a quick link to allow you to force-sync your project.  No more waiting for the scheduled pull from Basecamp or having to navigate deep into your project options to make it happen.  (We also moved the story queue link to this area)
