We've got a set of features we're working on right now.  Things like an epic story tool, improving the documentation, cleaning up the remote API, and creating a mobile client.

After this set of work is done, the next major effort is going into improving our existing 3rd party integrations, and creating some new ones.

Please, let us know if/how you're using the current integrations.  Where those are lacking.  And let us know what other services you'd like to see support for.  We'd love to hear how you'd like to see some of the integration work as well.

We'll be gathering that info in this support forum thread:  http://support.scrumdo.com/discussions/suggestions/43-what-third-party-integrations-would-you-like-to-see
