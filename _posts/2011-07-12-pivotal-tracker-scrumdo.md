Are you a Pivotal Tracker user that wants to give ScrumDo a go?  Guy Romm, one of our ScrumDo users, has just posted a python script to help you get your pivotal tracker stories imported into your ScrumDo account!

Find it here:
https://github.com/guyromm/Pivotal2ScrumDo

All the folks here at ScrumDo want to send Guy a big Thank You!

We haven't had a chance to try it out yet, but there's pretty extensive documentation at that link with instructions.
