Now, you can post your GitHub commit messages into your ScrumDo project's scrum log.  To do that:

* On GitHub, go to your repo's page.
* Select "Admin"
* Select "Service Hooks"
* Find the ScrumDo option, and fill in the requested fields.

Now, every time you push a set of changes to GitHub, an entry will be made in your project's scrum log with the commit messages, links to the commits, and a link to a diff showing exactly what changed.

Also, in your commit messages, you can update the status of stories.  Type Story #(num) Status as part of your commit message. 

Examples:

* Story #13 Done
* Story #5 Doing
* Story #3 Reviewing

Please let us know what you think!
