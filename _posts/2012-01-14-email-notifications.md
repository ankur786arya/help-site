You can now sign up for email notifications of your projects.  Select what events you want to receive email on the [email notification page](http://www.scrumdo.com/email/email_config).

This config can tie into your "watched" projects information to help centralize the decision of what projects you care about.  Alternatively, you can receive emails on all your projects, or on items assigned to you.

The End of Iteration report runs the night after the last day of your iteration and gives a nice high level summary of everything that was completed.  This is a great report to get your boss to subscribe to.

Before, we had a single daily digest email you could sign up for.  This new method replaces that daily digest email config, so if you want to continue getting those you'll have to set it up again.
