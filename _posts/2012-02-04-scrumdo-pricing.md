You may have noticed, we changed our pricing starting today.  You can see the new pricing on your organization subscription page, or on the site wide pricing list:  
  
[http://www.scrumdo.com/plans](http://www.scrumdo.com/plans)

All current users (even the free plan) are grandfathered into the prices and feature levels they previously had.  There won't be any sudden change of pricing or feature levels.  You can upgrade to one of the new plans at any time by going to your organization subscription plan and picking out the one you want.

As always, we appreciate every one of our users and thank you for helping to make ScrumDo a success.
