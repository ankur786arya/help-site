We've been working on some major UI improvements, particularly with how you navigate within ScrumDo.  As part of that, we'll be introducing a new menu system in the top header portion of the page that replaces most of our side bar navigation.

There's a menu for your organization, one for your project, and another for some account specific functions.  Since the side bar went away on most pages, that gave us a bit more room to work with so we've gone through and made small changes to every page.

Before we roll out a change of this magnitude, we're hoping for some user feedback.  To that end, we've opened up the [beta.scrumdo.com](http://beta.scrumdo.com/) website.  This beta site points at our live production database.  So everything is real and you can try it out in your normal day to day work.

If you try it, please let us know how you like it (or don't like it) on our [support forums](http://support.scrumdo.com/).  When you post, please let us know you're looking at the Beta site.
