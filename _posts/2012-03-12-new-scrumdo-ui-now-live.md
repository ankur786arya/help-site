Over the past few weeks, we've been working on some general UI improvements to the site.  Our primary goal was to make it easier and quicker to navigate to the different areas of ScrumDo.  

If you're looking for something, the chances are you'll find it in the new menu system in the header of the site.

Clicking your organization name will show you all of the organization level pages.  You'll also get a list of projects.  Depending on how many projects you have access to, you might see them all, or a truncated list of your watched projects.

Clicking on the project name in the header, will open a menu that allows you to navigate within your project.  

In the old system, you may have run into a problem of "you can't get there from here".  If you were on the iteration view, there was no way to get to planning poker, and if you were on the scrum board, there was no way to get to the scrum board of a different iteration.  

Now, you can see all of the project level tools at all times, and if looking at an iteration page, you can switch which iteration you're looking at.

Since this freed up some horizontal space, we went through every page and widened where possible so you could see more at a time.

We welcome any feedback (good or bad!) on our [support forum](http://support.scrumdo.com/).
