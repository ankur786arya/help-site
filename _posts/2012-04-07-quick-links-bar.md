We rolled out a minor change today.  There's now a new "Quick Links" button in the right hand margin.  Clicking that will slide out a panel with some of the most common links that people use on ScrumDo.

It's similar to our old navigation system which was loved by many of you, but by treating it as an optional "quick links" area instead of the primary site navigation, we can keep it small and light.  


Let us know what you think.
