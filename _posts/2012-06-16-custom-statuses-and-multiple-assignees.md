ScrumDo now supports defining custom statuses.  To enable them, go to your project admin page and define your statuses.

The four default statuses are required, but you can rename them if you like.  After you've defined your custom statuses, they'll appear throughout your project including on your scrum board.

Also, within stories, you can now assign multiple assignees to each story.  We've switched up the interface from a drop-down to an auto-completing field that works just like our tags feature.  When you start to type a username, you'll see all the matches and be able to pick one.
