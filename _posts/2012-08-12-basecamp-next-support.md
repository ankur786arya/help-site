Today, we rolled out a new extra for Basecamp.  This one only supports the new version of Basecamp, and our older extra is still there for Basecamp Classic support.  You can enable the extra via the extras menu in your project.  

This version of the extra is far simpler to use than the previous one.  To authenticate, you merely need to click a few buttons instead of tracking down an API key and entering your URL.

Please give it a try and let us know what you think.
