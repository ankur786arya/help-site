Two of my favorite updates from our October 5th update are focused on making the story list easier to use.  The first, is the ability to view the list in three different sizes.  Shown above is the smallest size, reducing stories down to a line or two of text.  Using this view, it's really easy to quickly rank your stories by dragging them up or down.

Also shown above, is the new multi-select option.  Using this, you can select several stories, and then apply an action against them all such as:

* Assign the stories to a person
* Move them to another iteration
* Move them to another project
* Set the statuses
* Bulk delete
