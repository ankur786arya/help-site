title: Saving Searches
---

We've released a new search widget that unifies the searching and filtering experience across the site.

Clicking the cog icon on the right will open a search window that helps you build more complex searches.  It will also let you save that search criteria to be reused in the future.

Clicking the magnifying icon on the left will show a list of previously saved searches that you can pick from.

As always, you can type your search into the text field in the middle and press enter to perform the search.

For more information about search, visit the [help page](/help/search.html).
