title: Time Estimates
---

In our most recent release, we have added the ability to track time estimates for
stories or tasks.

Each task and story has an hours:minutes field that you can fill out while creating or editing.  This
represents a time estimate for that story or task.

The estimate for a story is in addition to the estimates for tasks under that story.  So if you enter 1 hour for a
story, and 1 hours for a task within the story, that's telling ScrumDo you expect all that work to take two hours.

You can read about time estimates, and how they relate to our time tracking features on [this help page](/help/timeestimates.html).

When you use the time estimation feature, you'll be able to view the progress of an iteration or release by hours
in addition to points.  See the help page for [chart types](/help/scrum/charts.html) to learn more.
