Sometimes, you need to draw attention to a particular story.  Now, in ScrumDo when you apply
a blocked or urgent tag, the story will be tinted red or yellow respectively.

In the future, we're planning on making this configurable so you can set up your own tags/colors,
but we wanted to get this simple solution out quickly.
