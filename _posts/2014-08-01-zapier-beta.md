title: Zapier Beta
---

Over the past week, we've spent some time integrating with [Zapier](http://www.zapier.com/) so that you
can make ScrumDo work with over 300 other services.  Zapier allows you to
create conduits between applications called Zaps.  We're currently in a beta to make this
as useful as possible - [beta invite link](https://zapier.com/developer/invite/11239/c811e31c3d1f48219dbf34e423312364/).

#### What can you do with it?

Here are some of the zaps I've been testing with:

 This list is just scratching the surface of what's possible using this platform.
 We're looking for some people to try this out and let us know how we could improve it.

#### Beta Invite

 Since we're not listed on the Zapier app directory yet, you'll need to use
 [this invite link](https://zapier.com/developer/invite/11239/c811e31c3d1f48219dbf34e423312364/).
