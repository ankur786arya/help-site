# Special thanks 

Unfortunately, we can no longer give credit to those who have helped make ScrumDo more secure.
We have found doing-so encourages dozens of self-described security researchers to run
generic, automated vunerability scanners against our site in the hopes of finding something.
At times, these scanners have exceeded 100 requests per second, putting a strain on some
parts of our infrastructure.

While we appreciate responsible disclosure, a few bad apples have ruined it for everyone.
