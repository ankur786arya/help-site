---

### Introduction

Choosing whether to create a "Scrum" based or a "Scrumban" based project is one of your first decisions points, when you create a project in ScrumDo. 

If you are doing traditional Scrum then a "Scrum" project should be the right fit for you. 

Generally speaking, Scrum projects work best when you want to have a fixed 
cadence of time in which you want to deliver work regularly. Work is more or less defined 
by a product owner and accepted & delivered by a mature team.

Scrumban project incorporate Kanban practices such as continuous flow.

Again generalizing, Scrumban projects work best when you have less defined pieces of work to be done.

This page aims to help you understand some of the differences between the two types of projects in ScrumDo.
