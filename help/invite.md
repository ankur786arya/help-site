title: Inviting Users

To invite someone to your organization, go into the Teams interface, select a team, and then enter
their email address or their ScrumDo username.

<h3>Access Levels</h3>

When creating a team, there are four access types you can choose from.

* **Read Only** - These users can see the projects associated with the team, but they can't make changes.
* **Read / Write** - These users can see the project, create stories, and generally participate in the project.  Most users will require this level of access.
* **Admin** - These users can do everything the R/W users can, plus they can access the project admin page to change project level options.
* **Staff** - Staff teams give admin access to all projects in an organization.   Staff are allowed to modify subscription details, create teams or projects, and to invite new users to teams.

If a user does not have read access to a project, they won't even see that project listed.
