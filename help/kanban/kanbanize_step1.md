You can convert an existing ScrumDo Timebox based project into a Flow based project using our Project conversion wizard.  You can find this wizard on the project admin page for your scrum time box project.

###About the conversion process

<ul>
    <li><b>It's Safe</b> 
        <p>We will create a <b>copy</b> of your project, your original project will not be modified.</p>
    </li>
    <li><b>Easy Wizard</b>
        <p>You will go through a three step wizard to set up options for your project.</p>
    </li>
    <li><b>Low Risk</b>
        <p>If you don't like the new project, you're free to delete or archive it.</p>
    </li>
</ul>   

###Classes of Service

The first decision you'll need to make while converting your project is what classes of service you'd like your new project to have.

![Classes of service](images/kanbanize_cos.png)

You can define up to 9 difference classes of service (as you enter a one, a new entry will appear).

A class of service represents a flow of work through your process. They will be visually represented on your board as separate swim lanes. You could use them for things such as:

* Work priority (expediated vs. normal) This is the most common option
* Types of work (feature vs. bug fix)
* By team assigned

Your story statuses will automatically be set up as steps in your workflow and form the columns of your initial board.

The default class of service will have a taller row than the others, but you can always edit sizing after you're done with the import.
