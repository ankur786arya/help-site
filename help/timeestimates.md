title: Time Estimates and Time Tracking
---

ScrumDo allows you to make time estimates on your stories and tasks, and then track time spent working on those.

### Estimating Time

Each task and story has an hours:minutes field that you can fill out while creating or editing.  This
represents a time estimate for that story or task.

The estimate for a story is in addition to the estimates for tasks under that story.  So if you enter 1 hour for a
story, and 1 hours for a task within the story, that's telling ScrumDo you expect all that work to take two hours.

### Tracking Time

Any member of your organization can access the "Track Time" option from the top menu bar to get to the
time tracking form.

From here, they can select a project plus an optional iteration, story, and task to track time against. 

By default, time is tracked for the current date, but previous days can be specified by filling in the
date field in the lower left.

Time is tracked in minutes or hours.  To track minutes, simply type in a number.  To track hours, use the
HH:MM format such as 1:00 for one hour or 1:30 for an hour and a half.


### Extracting Tracked Time

Staff members of your organization can extract time sheets that show all of the time tracked.  These can be
downloaded in excel format for use in other systems (such as your billing system).

To access this, select your organization menu in the top navbar, and select the **time sheets** option.

You will be presented with a form to select a date range, and optionally a person, to view the time sheet for.
Clicking the "Download Timesheet" link will generate an excel file for you.

### Viewing Progress

**Iterations**  
When you use the time estimation feature, you'll be able to view the progress of an iteration by hours
in addition to points.  See the help page for [chart types](scrum/charts.html) to learn more.

**Releases**  
In addition to iterations, you will be able to track your progress by hours in any releases you have configured for
your organization.
