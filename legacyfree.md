# Free Plan Changes

ScrumDo users are great!  We've been offering free plans for users since we started almost 4 years ago.  When we started,
our free plans were much more generous than they are now, but we had grandfathered in those old free
plans when we changed.

Starting Feburary 1st, everyone on a free plan will be switched over to our current free plan which
includes 3 users, 1 project and is limited in some of our premium features.  For some people, this will
be a significant downgrade.

If you require more than that, we invite you to become a paying member of ScrumDo.

Update: Febuary 24th, 2014 - Not all accounts were migrated on the 1st, that has been corrected today.  
This means some people got an extra ~3 weeks reprieve on this change.
