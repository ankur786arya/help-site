# Privacy Policy
----
      
      
*Last Updated: December 2013*
     
     
     
Your privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and disclose and make use of personal information. The following outlines our privacy policy.
     
     
        
#### Categories of Information We Collect

**Information you provide to us: ** When you register as a user on either a free or paid basis, and when you complete a contact form or send us an email, you provide us with information we collect. This information may include your ip address, name, physical address, email address, phone number, cell phone number, and other demographic information.  By providing us with this information you consent to it being collected, used, disclosed and stored by us in accordance with this privacy policy.

**Other information we receive and store: ** When you visit our website, we or our third-party partners may store “cookies” to enhance your user experience.  “Cookies” are strings of alphanumeric data maintained on your computer.

With cookies we become aware of and collect information about when you visit our website, when you use certain services, your browser type and version, your operating system and platform and other similar information. You may turn off all cookies that have been placed on your computer by following the instructions on your browser on how to block cookies that have been placed on your computer. If you block our cookies, however, it will be more difficult (and maybe even impossible) to use parts of our website and services.

We may partner with third-party providers, such as Google, to display ads to you on other websites you visit as you browse the internet.  You can learn about ways to manage or opt-out of third-party tracking of this nature by visiting [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices] (http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices)

**Information from other sources --** We may obtain additional information about you by using your email address or other information to directly, or through one or more services, search the internet and other sources. From these searches we may obtain information that appears to be related to your email address or other information such as a name, age and participation in social media websites.
      
      
      
#### Use and Disclosure of Personal Information

we will use and disclose your personal information only as follows:

* We may use information to promote the use (including the continued use) of our website and services. For example, if you visit our website and do not sign up for any services, we may attempt to display advertising or otherwise communicate with you to consider our services. Similarly, if you use any of our services and may benefit from using one or more other services we offer, we may send you an email telling you about those other services.

* To send system alerts or special messages including planned outages, new features offered, abuse warnings, changes to our terms of use or this privacy policy, and possibly other documents and agreements.

* To provide customer support and obtain feedback.

* To support and improve our services including adding new features 

* To bill and collect sums owed to us.  We use third parties to handle secure credit card transaction processing.  For services purchased through our site, billing information is generally maintained by those third parties and not by us.

* To help enforce compliance with our terms of use and applicable law.

* To protect the rights and safety of us and our employees, members, owners, officers and others
to meet legal requirements such as complying with court orders and valid subpoenas.

* To prosecute and defend a court, arbitration or similar proceeding.

* To communicate with you concerning your account for an informational as opposed to a promotional purpose.

* To transfer your information in the event of the sale of substantially all of the assets of our business to a third-party or in the event of a merger, consolidation or acquisition.  In such event, however, any acquirer will be subject to our obligations under this privacy policy.

* We will only retain personal information as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes.

* We will collect personal information by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the individual concerned.

* We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with these principles in order to ensure that the confidentiality of personal information is protected and maintained.
     
     
          
#### Notification of Changes

Any changes to this privacy policy will be posted to our website. If you’re a registered user, we may also email a notification to the last email address on record. Changes will become effective on the date we post them to our website.

You may object to any changes within twenty-one (21) days after they’re posted on our website, in which case none of the proposed changes will be effective with respect to information that we have already collected from you. Changes will apply, however, to information we collect or access from you in the future.

There may be non-marketing purposes for which we can’t or are not willing to treat information of user accounts differently.  So if you object to changes in our privacy policy which relate to those purposes we’ll have to terminate your account.  Should we ever changed our privacy policy to incorporate an expanded right to use or disclose personal information for marketing purposes, however, you’ll be able to opt out without any such termination.
