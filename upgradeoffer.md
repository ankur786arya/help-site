# Announcement of Upgrade offer

ScrumDo customers are great!  You're constantly sharing ways we can improve your
experience, and we try hard to respond to common needs.  Over the next few months,
you'll see some big improvements to ScrumDo that we will be announcing soon.

Today, we start with some news thatâ€™s always hard to share.  **Effective February 1st,** we'll 
be modifying our NEW account plans.  Part of our changes include a
modest price increases across our paid plans.  This represents our first
substantial price change since first launching ScrumDo over 3 years ago, and is
necessary to keep assuring our reliability, support and continued product
enhancements!

Now, the really happy news

-   If you're an existing customer, your current plan and pricing **won't be
    effected for one year**.

-   If you've been considering an upgrade to a higher plan level, doing so
    before February 1st will lock in current pricing for another year.  **UPGRADE
    now and lock in current pricing for another year!**   

-   Want to save even more? Pay for a yearly subscription and get 2
    months for free!

-   Even with our modest price increases, ScrumDo will continue to offer the
    lowest "per user" cost of any comparative tool on the market!  And the
    changes we'll be rolling out over the next couple of months will make
    ScrumDo an even greater value for you and your teams.
